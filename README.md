<h1># music_with_python2</h1>
<h3>This is the part two of using audio in python.</h3>
If you haven't checked my repo music_with_python or don't know about winsound module then go through my previous repo [here](https://github.com/BhargavKadali39/music_with_python)
<h2>In this part we are going to learn how to use default and custom(only .wav) audio files in our python programs </h2>  

Note: Make sure the audio files provided are in .wav format or else this module might not work.
